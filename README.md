🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This project demonstrates how data science and visualization can be used to forecast retail sales and provide actionable insights. Using historical sales data, I built data-driven web dashboard built with Python, Pandas, and Streamlit to analyze retail sales data, forecast future trends, and provide business insights.

The goal is to:

  * Forecast sales trends for better inventory & business planning.
  * Provide executives and managers with a visual, data-driven dashboard.
  * Highlight my skills in data analysis, forecasting, and visualization.

🚀 Features

    📊 Interactive dashboards for sales and customer analysis
    ⏱️ Real-time filtering by date range, category, and more
    📈 Sales trend forecasting using historical data
    👥 Customer behavior and segmentation insights
    🌐 Deployed via Streamlit for an accessible web app experience

Key Steps:

 * Data Preparation → Cleaned and pre-processed historical sales data.
 * Modeling → Trained forecasting models (ARIMA/Prophet/ML) to predict sales.
 * Web App Development → Integrated the model into a web framework for real-time forecasts.
 * Visualization → Built interactive charts (Plotly/Altair/Matplotlib) for insights.
 * Deployment → Hosted the app on (Heroku / Streamlit Cloud / AWS / etc.).

📈 Results & Insights

  * Achieved XX% forecast accuracy (RMSE/MAE = …).
  * Identified seasonal spikes (holidays, weekends).
  * Business recommendation: optimize inventory before high-demand months.

Skills Demonstrated:

  * Data Cleaning & Forecasting
  * Machine Learning for Time-Series
  * Web Application Development
  * Data Visualization & Storytelling
